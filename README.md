## Crime Data Analysis: Los Angeles (2020 - Present)

### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing crime data in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present using a dataset obtained from 
[data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present).

 The goal is to clean, filter, and visualize crime trends, providing insights into crime patterns over time. This project serves as a portfolio piece showcasing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization skills using Python.

### Objectives
	•	Data Cleaning & Filtering: Handle missing or inconsistent data, remove duplicates, and format the dataset for analysis.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, outliers, and patterns in crime rates over time and across different areas.
	•	Data Visualization: Create charts, heatmaps, and other visual representations to make crime trends more understandable.
	•	Insights & Findings: Summarize key observations and potential implications based on the analyzed data.

### Technologies Used
	•	Python: Core programming language for analysis
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment
	•	Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
	•	NumPy: Numerical computations
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

### Dataset
	•	Source: data.gov
	•	Contents: Crime reports from 2020 to the present, including crime type, location, date, and other relevant attributes.
	•	Size & Format: CSV format with structured columns
